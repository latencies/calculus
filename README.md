# CSPB 4830: Coding Calculus

## Week 12 - Reflection and Self-Assessment



### Course Reflection

This class has been a very rewarding journey for me. Through pouring in the work to pursue thorough, in-depth exploration of the topics that we have been exploring through our workbooks, I've discovered a newfound and deep respect for the beauty of calculus and how this course tells that story. 

Since I work independently on my workbooks, I particulary pride myself in arriving at solutions and explorations that are unique to my viewpoint and experience. Majority of the topics we've explored provide a great deal of latitude as to how far and how deep we want to explore the question. It is my hope that I've shown that I have not been afraid to dive deeper in trying to fully understand the questions presented. 

In our deeper dive into the S-I-R model and the logistic equation in [Week 2](/Week_2.pdf), I spent several days to fully flesh out my ideas in code and with extraneous explorations to present my answers and I was able to do it in a way that spoke to my personal questions about the topic. I found this exercise very immersing and rewarding.

In my exploration into the derivative in [Week 3](/Week_3.pdf), I went above and beyond to demonstrate with code, how each of the quotient estimates we were exploring performed. 

In [Week 4](/Week_4.pdf), when asked to figure out which method and what 'h' the Wolfram Alpha calculator might be using, I was able to systematically discover a 'possible' answer with my own personal code.

[Week 7](/Week_7.pdf) allowed for a fun exploration into the topic of accumulation where I was able to further illustrate the concepts with plots. Similarly, in [Week 9](/Week_9.pdf), our visual exploration into Newton's method made it very rewarding to demonstrate with graphs.

Working independently has allowed me the freedom to explore the topics in my own way and arrive at a deeper, more personal understanding.

### Course Contributions

In our Piazza discussions, I've shown that I've been able to speak up about my perspective on questions we are still exploring as a group:

I've not been afraid to share my own process with the group as to how to approach certain questions:

Even when my answer seems contrary to what the group consensus might be, I've been able to share my perspective using code and plots:

### Self Assessment
I am proud of the work I put into my workbooks and my commitment to demonstrating my understanding to the best of my abilities. Although it's had its challenges, I've found working independently to be very rewarding. I am grateful to this class and Prof. Stade for allowing me to see more and deeper.
